			<h1>The short B-ball story</h1>
			<p>There once was this kid and his name was...
				<br>Basketball. Everyone clowned on him because his name was basketball. Even his own family 
				<br>laughed at his name, despite this constant torment from even his loved ones he decided that we
				<br>would live past it. He tried out for other sports like volleyball and tennis, unfortuneately he
				<br>learned he wasn't very athletic so his attempts were an utter failure. Eventually the overwhelming
				<br>weight of knowing that he wasn't good at any other sport pushed him to face his cruciable. He decided to
				<br>play basketball. From there his life worstened because when he attempted to play he soon relized that 
				<br>basketball might have been his name, but it was not his game. He failed horribly at that as well. Years
				<br>past by and ironically Basketball became a basketball coach, for all his hate of his name he found a
				<br>passion to growing and understanding the game. He eventually met a women her name was Tabletennis, and 
				<br>Basketball called her Ping-Pong for short. They got married settled down and had child. Remembering all 
				<br>the harsh treatment they were surcommed to they decided to name their child after something other than a
				<br>sport, they named their child Comedy.
